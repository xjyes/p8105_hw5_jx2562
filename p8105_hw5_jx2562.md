## Problem 1

Load the homicides dataset. Categorized the raw data by cites and
summarize the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved
homicides

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarise(total_homicides = n(),
            unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Here we have a data frame which describe the total number of homicide in
the cities and the number of unsolved homicides in the cities.

Now, we estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved in
Baltimore, MD.

``` r
baltimore_data = homicide_df |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 

baltimore_test = prop.test(pull(baltimore_data, unsolved_homicides), pull(baltimore_data, total_homicides)) |>
  broom::tidy()

print(paste("Estimated proportion for Baltimore: ", round(baltimore_test$estimate[1], 4)))
```

    ## [1] "Estimated proportion for Baltimore:  0.6456"

``` r
print(paste("Confidence interval for Baltimore: ", round(baltimore_test$conf.low, 4), "-", round(baltimore_test$conf.high, 4)))
```

    ## [1] "Confidence interval for Baltimore:  0.6276 - 0.6632"

Given the above pipeline, we can create a workflow to calculate the
estimate proportions and CIs for each cities.

``` r
run_prop_test <- function(city) {
  data <- homicide_df |>
    filter(city_state == city) 
  
  prop_test_result <- prop.test(pull(data, unsolved_homicides), pull(data, total_homicides))
  tidy_result <- broom::tidy(prop_test_result)
  
  tibble(
    estimated_proportion = tidy_result$estimate[1],
    conf_low = tidy_result$conf.low,
    conf_high = tidy_result$conf.high
  )
}
```

``` r
unsolved_prop <- homicide_df |>
  mutate(prop_test_results = map(city_state, run_prop_test)) |>
  unnest()

head(unsolved_prop)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 6
    ##   city_state    total_homicides unsolved_homicides estimated_proportion conf_low
    ##   <chr>                   <int>              <int>                <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 Albuquerque,…             378                146                0.386    0.337
    ## 2 Atlanta, GA               973                373                0.383    0.353
    ## 3 Baltimore, MD            2827               1825                0.646    0.628
    ## 4 Baton Rouge,…             424                196                0.462    0.414
    ## 5 Birmingham, …             800                347                0.434    0.399
    ## 6 Boston, MA                614                310                0.505    0.465
    ## # ℹ 1 more variable: conf_high <dbl>

The `unsolved_prop` data frame present the estimated proportion and CIs
for unsolved homicides in each city, along with the raw total count of
homicides and unsolved homicides.

Now we draw a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city.

``` r
unsolved_prop$city_state <- factor(unsolved_prop$city_state,  levels=unsolved_prop$city_state[order(unsolved_prop$estimated_proportion)])

ggplot(unsolved_prop, aes(x = city_state, y = estimated_proportion, ymin = conf_low, ymax = conf_high)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(0.2)) +
  labs(title = "Estimated Proportion of Unsolved Homicides with Confidence Intervals",
       x = "City",
       y = "Estimated Proportion") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

As the plot shows, **Tulsa, AL** shows the lowest estimated proportion
of unsolved homicides case as well as the highest error bar. The small
sample size may lead to the result. At the meantime, **Chicago, IL**
shows the highest estimated proportion and a very narrow error bar,
which may caused by a large sample size.
